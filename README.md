# Api_Testing_Array_Example
Array Example is used to demonstrate and test API requests and responses involving arrays or lists of data. It provides examples of how to structure requests with array parameters or how to handle responses that include arrays of data, helping users understand and work with array-related functionalities in their API interactions

**GetArray:**
It is examples of how to structure requests with array parameters or how to handle responses that include arrays of data.

**Newman_Report:**
Newman report" feature is used to generate detailed test reports for API collections run using the Newman command-line tool. It provides a summary of test results, including pass/fail statuses, response times, and error details, allowing users to analyze and share test results with team members or stakeholders.

**Newman_RunCommand:**
Newman Run Command is used to execute API collections from the command line using the Newman tool. It allows users to automate the execution of tests, run them in CMD pipelines, and generate detailed reports, enhancing the efficiency and scalability of API testing processes.
